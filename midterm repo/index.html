    <p><!-- Paragraph describing Grizzly Bear -->
      The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly,
      is a population or subspecies of the brown bear inhabiting North America. In addition to the mainland grizzly (Ursus arctos horribilis),
      other morphological forms of brown bear in North America are sometimes identified as grizzly bears. These include three living populations—the Kodiak bear (U. a. middendorffi),
      the Kamchatka bear (U. a. beringianus), and the peninsular grizzly (U. a. gyas)—as well as the extinct California grizzly (U. a. californicus),
      Mexican grizzly (formerly U. a. nelsoni), and Ungava-Labrador grizzly (formerly U. a. ungavaesis). On average, grizzly bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller.
      The Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus), inhabiting Russia, Northern China, Japan, and Korea, is sometimes referred to as the "black grizzly", although it is no more closely related to North American brown 
      bears than other subspecies of the brown bear around the world. Grizzly bears are some of the largest subspecies of brown bear, only being beaten by the Kamchatka brown bears and the Kodiak bears. Grizzly bears vary in size depending on timing and populations.
      The largest populations are the coastal grizzlies in the Alaskan peninsula, with males weighing 389 kilograms (858 lb) and females weighing 207 kilograms (456 lb).
      The populations in northern interior Canada are much smaller, with males weighing 139 kilograms (306 lb) and females weighing 95 kilograms (209 lb). This is actually similar to the American black bear population of the area.
      Average total length in this subspecies is between 198 cm (78 in) and 240 cm (94 in), with an average shoulder height of 102 cm (40 in) and hindfoot length of 28 cm (11 in). Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 g (18 oz).
