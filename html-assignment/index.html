            <p>
            Hi,I am Sristhi,a person always eager to explore new technology and expand horizons.Currently pursing my studies from <abbr title="Algonquin college">AC</abbr>.
            My journey for coding started when I was in my <em>10th</em>standard.I learned basic structure and coding of python.
            Finding joy in learning coding and designing made me choose this course . 
            And also exploring new places was the reason of me choosing to study in Canada </p>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 In my free time, I usually enjoy looking into online forums, tutorials, and tech communities to learn about the
                 newest trends and  advancements in the world of coding. 
                I have a strong interest in keeping up with the latest developments like blockchain, AI, and machine learning.
                I am also continuously looking for new ways to push the limits of what can be done with code.
                 </p>
